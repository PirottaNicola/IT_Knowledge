# Layout multipli della tastiera

## Soluzione (dovrebbe funzionare)

I don't know if it will work for everybody, but after you set all the languages you want in the Lang & region,

go to Settings > Time & Language > Language & Region > Administrative language setting

After you click on the on the Administrative language setting, it should open a new window,

On the new window, in the "Welcome screen and new user accounts" section, click on "Copy settings..."

make sure the setting in Current user box is the one you wanted, then just click on the 2 tick boxes below (Welcome screen and system accounts, New user accounts) then hit ok.

After all those steps I did this just as an extra precaution.

go to Settings > Accounts > Windows backup

click on the "Remember my preference" (expand the thing, not disable it entirely)

Turn "Language preferencees and dictionary" off

Then restart your PC. Every unwanted language should disappear. Sorry for the lack of images. This thing seems not to want to accept my screenshot :P

## Soluzione alternativa

I found a work around but it's a bad solution if you use multiple keyboard layouts:

Go to settings > Time & Language > Typing > Advanced keyboard settings

Check "Use the desktop language bar when it is available"

Now click the text under it that says "Language bar options"

In the new window make sure you're on the Language Bar tab

Under "Language Bar" select hidden

That's it. It doesn't fix it but at least it hides the layouts from your taskbar.
