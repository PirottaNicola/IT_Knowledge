Ajax works in an asycnhronous (non-blocking) processig model.
to create an Ajax request, browsers use the XMLHttpRequest object.

the server can respondo sending XML, HTML o JSON files.
to load JSON froma a different domain you can use JSONP
but onlu if the code is from a trusted source.

JQuery has methods that make it easier to use Ajax.
.load() is the simplest way to load html into a page.
.ajax() is more powerful and complex

When a JSON is sent from a server to a browser, is transmitted as
a string (JSON.stringify). When the browser receives it, it has to 
convert it into an object (JSON.parse).
