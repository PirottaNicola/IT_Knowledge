http is the most common protocol to communicate online
http is a protocol that allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.

'http' stands for 'HyperText Transfer Protocol'. The 'HyperText' part refers to the fact that http generally is used to serve HTML documents. The 'Transfer Protocol' part describes the way the messages are formatted and interchanged.

http is a stateless protocol, which means the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. For example, when you navigate from one page to another, the server does not remember the previous page. This makes http a simple, but powerful protocol.
