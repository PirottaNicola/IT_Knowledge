    <h1>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h1>
    <p>At the heart of SEO is the idea of working out which terms people are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site and then using these terms in the right places on your site to increase the chances that search engines will show a link to
        your site in their results. search engines do not only look at what appears on your site. They also consider how many sites link to you (and how relevant those links are). On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve
        their rating in search engines. The main component of this is looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search engine if they wanted to find your site, and then including these in the text and HTML code for your site in order
        to help the search engines know that your site covers these topics. Ensuring that any images have appropriate text in the value of their alt attribute also helps search engines understand the content of images. Getting other sites to link to you
        is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours. if you were running a website that sold fish bait, then a link from a hairdresser is not
        likely to be considered as relevant as one from an angling community. Search engines also look at the words between the opening <a> tag and closing </a> tag in the link. If the text in the link contains keywords (rather than just click here or
        your website address) it may be considered more relevant. The words that appear in links to your site should also appear in the text of the page that the site links to.
    </p>
    <h2>On-page SEO</h2>
    <p>there are seven key places where keywords (the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order to improve its findability:
        <ul>
            <li>Page Title</li>
            <li>Url</li>
            <li>Heading</li>
            <li>Text</li>
            <li>Link Text</li>
            <li>Image ALT text</li>
            <li>Page description (inside the head, using meta tags)</li>
        </ul>
        the right keywords for you can be choosen with the help of sites as
        <a href="https://www.wordtracker.com">this</a>
    </p>

    <h2> Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>
        The site will give you a piece of tracking code which you need to put on every page of your site. Every time someone loads a page of your site, the tracking code sends data to the Google servers where it is stored. Google then provides a webbased interface
        that allows you to see how visitors use your site. A tracking code is provided by Google Analytics for each website you are tracking. It should appear just before the closing </head> tag. The code does not alter the appearance of your
        web pages.
    </p>
    <h2>Domain Names & Hosting</h2>
    <p>In order to put your site on the web you will need a domain name and web hosting.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Domain Names: Your domain name is your web address (e.g. google.com or bbc. co.uk). There are many websites that allow you to register domain names. Usually you will have to pay an annual fee to keep that domain name.</li>
        <li>Web Hosting: So that other people can see your site, you will need to upload it to a web server. Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet. They are specially set up to serve web pages when they are requested.
            With the exception of some very large sites, most websites live on web servers run by web hosting companies. This is usually far cheaper and more reliable than trying to run your own web servers.</li>
    </ul>
